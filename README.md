# pyEPABC
A Python implementation of EP-ABC for likelihood-free, probabilistic inference.

This code is based on Simon Barthelm√©'s [Matlab implementation](https://sites.google.com/site/simonbarthelme/software) 
of EP-ABC as described in the corresponding [article](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.864178). See the documentation 
of `run_EPABC` for further details.

The `examples`-folder contains two examples demonstrating the usage of pyEPABC.
